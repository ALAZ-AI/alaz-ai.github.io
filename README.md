- **Custom Allow/Block Lists:** Take full control of your network with custom rules to allow or block specific domains.

## 4. How It Works Section

**Objective:** Explain the technical workings of ALAZ in a simple, easy-to-understand way.

**Visuals:**
- A simplified, animated infographic that visualizes the data flow:
  1. A device makes a DNS request.
  2. The request goes to ALAZ Sentry.
  3. Sentry checks its cache and policies from Codex.
  4. If the domain is unknown, it's sent to Oracle for analysis.
  5. A safe response is sent back to the device.
- The animation should be clean and professional.

**Content:**
- **Headline:** **Effortless Security, Powered by Intelligent Technology.**
- **Step 1: The Request:** When you access a website, your device sends a DNS request. Instead of going to your ISP's DNS server, it goes to ALAZ.
- **Step 2: The Analysis:** Our high-performance Sentry engine checks the request against your policies and our global threat intelligence database (Codex).
- **Step 3: The Decision:** If the domain is safe, you're connected. If it's malicious or on your blocklist, the request is blocked. Unknown domains are sent to our Oracle AI for analysis.
- **Step 4: The Learning Loop:** The results from Oracle's analysis are used to continuously improve our threat detection and content classification, making the entire network smarter and safer for everyone.
